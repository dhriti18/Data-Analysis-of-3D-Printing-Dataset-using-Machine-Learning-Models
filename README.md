# Data-Analysis-of-3D-Printing-Dataset-using-Machine-Learning-Models
This repository contains coursework focusses on analyzing a 3D printing dataset and predicting key quality metrics using machine learning models.
Below processes were performed in the project,
Data cleaning and visualization of the dataset
Implementation of machine learning models for predicting:
Tensile Strength
Elongation
Surface Roughness
Comparisons between models built from scratch and models using scikit-learn
Model evaluation, tuning, and overfitting analysis
